# Clone all

## Description
This is a script I wrote to make my life easier when evaluating students' exercises.

## Usage

Node must be installed lol

For fairly obvious reasons, the list of people is empty. One must add the list of github usernames to iterate over.
If you're a Hoxton academy staff member, you can get a list of people in the exercise evaluation spreadsheet.
If you're not, then what are you doing here? Just kidding, find a repo with a bunch of forks and use those people / repo name here.

run with `node clone-all.js`. 
You will be asked for a repo name and a few y/n questions.

## Note

Every execution is synchronous for 2 reasons:
1. It's easier, duh!
2. I run this script while I brew my coffee, so I am not worried about performance.

## Questions

Feel free to reach out to this Ed guy.
