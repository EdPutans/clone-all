# Clone all

## Description
This is a script I wrote to make my life easier when evaluating students' exercises.

## Usage

Node must be installed lol

run with `node clone-all.js`. 
You will be asked for a repo name and a few y/n questions.

## Note

Every execution is synchronous for 2 reasons:
1. It's easier, duh!
2. I run this script while I brew my coffee, so I am not worried about performance.

## Questions

Feel free to reach out to this Ed guy.
